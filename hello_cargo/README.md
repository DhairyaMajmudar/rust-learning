# Notes

1. Run the command `cargo new hello_world` to create such type of folder structure.

2. In rust packages are known as crates.

3. Cargo.toml file is like the package.json file in rust.

4. To run the cargo project run the commands `cargo build` this will build and compile the project.

5. Now to run the compiled executable file run the command `./target/debug/hello_cargo`.

6. Cargo stores the executalbe files into target/debug folder.

7. Or or you can also run the command `cargo run` -> This command will build and run the project all together.

8. `cargo check` command can check the if the code compiles or not w/o creating exectuables. This is a fast process to do that's why its often used several times.
